        <h1>Welcome to Clinical Insights AI Assistant</h1>

<!-- Application description -->
<p>
    Clinical Insights AI is designed to showcase the potential of effective prompt engineering in healthcare. This application helps healthcare providers generate quick, AI-powered insights from patient visit notes, assisting in tasks like generating summaries, CPT and ICD-10 codes, medication adherence prompts, and patient-friendly lab result summaries, follow ups, pre-visit planning. This is just the beginningâ€”the next evolution will involve fine-tuning the model with specialized domain-specific knowledge to further enhance accuracy and relevance in clinical settings.

            <h2>Prompter Types</h2>

            <p><strong>CPT Code Prompter:</strong> Extracts appropriate CPT codes, including E&M, procedures, referrals, and CPT II quality measures, based solely on the visit note content. Provides explanations for each code recommended.</p>
            
            <p><strong>ICD-10 Code Prompter:</strong> Recommends ICD-10 codes based on the visit note, including relevant codes for Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). The prompter explains why each code was chosen based on the note.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chart Summary Prompter:</strong> Summarizes the key findings of the patient visit, strictly using information provided in the note without any additional inference.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Lab Result Email Prompter:</strong> Generates patient-friendly emails summarizing lab results, ensuring clarity and trends based on the visit note.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Medication Adherence Prompter:</strong> Provides simple, patient-friendly reminders for medication adherence, based on responses from patient forms and past visit notes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Follow-Up Prompter:</strong> Identifies and curates follow-up needs from past visit notes, specifying the dates and types of follow-ups required. Provides explanations for each follow-up identified and tracks future appointments based on visit note instructions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>HCC Coder Prompter:</strong> Identifies relevant Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) ICD-10 codes from the visit note, ensuring all recommendations are grounded in the provided text. It explains the reasoning behind each recommendation and avoids any assumptions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>SDOH Prompter:</strong> Recommends Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) ICD-10 codes based on the visit note, providing an explanation for each code that relates directly to the visit text. If no SDOH codes apply, it clearly states that none were found.</p>
           
            <p><strong>Pre-Visit Planning Prompter:</strong> Creates a pre-visit summary to help clinicians prepare, ensuring recommendations are based solely on available EHR data.</p> 
        </div>

        <!-- New Section: Emphasis on No Hallucination and Justified Recommendations -->
        <h2>Accuracy and Justification</h2>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> One of the key features of our AI assistant is the emphasis on accuracy. The AI has been specifically instructed to avoid hallucinating or making assumptions beyond the provided visit notes. Every recommendation, whether it's a diagnosis code, CPT code, or follow-up action, is grounded strictly in the information present in the visit note.</p>

        <p>This ensures that the AI assistant offers reliable, justifiable insights that can assist clinicians and billing teams in making informed decisions. Each recommendation is accompanied by an explanation that cites the relevant portion of the visit note, providing a clear rationale for the selected codes or actions.</p>
